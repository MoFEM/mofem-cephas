\section simple_elasticity Simple elastic problem

Introduction to fundamental MoFEM functionalities and capabilities by solving a simple linear elastic problem.

\section poisson_problem The Poisson equation

The Poisson equation is solved using MoFEM::Simple interface. The generic
procedure is applied to one of the simples PDEs. In order to make the problem instructional, 
essential boundary conditions are enforced by Lagrange multipliers.

- \subpage poisson_tut1

Tutorial focusses attention on implementation of finite element user operators,
setting integration rule and using \ref ftensor.

\section snes_nonlinear_tut Nonlinear problem

Minimal surface area (soap film on the wire): Tutorial showing step by step
implementation of nonlinear problem. It presents how to set up the problem
from scratch, calculate matrices and solve the problem using MoFEM and
PETSc

\section mix_adpativity_tut Mix formulation and h-adaptivity

This example shows how to solve transport problem using mix element with an
independent approximation for fluxes and function values.  Also, it shows how to
integrate over mesh skeleton to evaluate error and how to use a posterior error
estimator to drive mesh adaptivity (h-adaptivity).

- \subpage mix_transport

In this tutorial, we show how to solve time dependent nonlinear problem using
mix formulation applied to unsaturated water transport in heterogeneous soil.
