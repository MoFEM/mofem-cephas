How to add a new module and program {#how_to_add_new_module_and_program}
==========================================================

[TOC]

This tutorial assumes that you have installed MoFEM with developer version using
the script provided in \ref installation. And therefore, you probably have paths
for the source code and the binary files (e.g. for `Release` build type) of the
Core Library and the Basic User Module as follows

- Core Library
  - Source code: *$HOME/mofem_install/mofem-cephas/*
  - Binary files (build directory): *$HOME/mofem_install/mofem-cephas/core-build-RelWithDebInfo-abcd1234*
- Basic User Module
  - Source code: *$HOME/mofem_install/mofem-cephas/mofem/users_modules/*
  - Binary files (build directory): *$HOME/mofem_install/mofem-cephas/mofem/users_modules/um-build-RelWithDebInfo-abcd1234*

# How to add a new module

## An existing module

To add a new MoFEM module that already developed, for example [Solid Shell
Module](https://bitbucket.org/likask/mofem_um_solid_shell_prism_element/src/master/), you may wish to follow these steps

- Locate Basic User Module source code
```
cd $HOME/mofem_install/mofem-cephas/mofem/users_modules/
```

- Clone Solid Shell Module
```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/likask/mofem_um_solid_shell_prism_element.git
```

- Compile codes for all modules
```
cd $HOME/mofem_install/mofem-cephas/mofem/users_modules/um-build-RelWithDebInfo-abcd1234
make -j4
```

- By now you should see all the executables generated in the folder within `um-build-RelWithDebInfo-abcd1234`
```
cd mofem_um_solid_shell_prism_element
```

- Run the unit test (if the module has one)
```
spack load cmake
ctest
```

If you did every thing correctly, you should see the paths for MoFEM
Solid Shell Module are as follows

- MoFEM Solid Shell Module
  - Source code: *$HOME/mofem_install/mofem-cephas/mofem/users_modules/mofem_um_solid_shell_prism_element*
  - Binary files (build directory): *$HOME/mofem_install/mofem-cephas/mofem/users_modules/um-build-RelWithDebInfo-abcd1234/mofem_um_solid_shell_prism_element*

## New module for your own purpose

The quickest way to create your own module is to replicate a module that already
available in MoFEM and then replace the existing source codes with your own. For
example, you can replicate MoFEM Solid Shell Module 
following general steps as follows

- Clone the module to somewhere outside of MoFEM installation directory
- Change file names and descriptions
- Be careful with `CMakeLists.txt`, `InstalledAddModule.cmake`. Make sure all
  the names and paths are consistent with the new module name of your choice
- Delete unnecessary source code files
- Once everything done, create a new repository of your own on
  [Github](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
- Upload your new files to the remote repository
- Follow steps in the previous section to clone and setup your new module in
  MoFEM (How to add a new module - An existing module).

# How to add a new program

The quickest way to add a new program to an existing module in your
MoFEM installation directory is to replicate a program that already available in
the same module of your choice. For example, you can replicate `vec-0`
program in MoFEM Basic User Module following general steps as follows

- Go to:
  $HOME/mofem_install/mofem-cephas/mofem/users_modules/tutorials/
- Copy tutorial, e.g. `vec-0` and paste it in the same place
- Change file names and descriptions
- Be careful with `CMakeLists.txt`. Make sure all the names and paths are consistent with the program name of your choice
- Delete unnecessary source code files
- Once everything done, compile source code by
```
cd $HOME/mofem_install/mofem-cephas/mofem/users_modules/um-build-RelWithDebInfo-abcd1234/tutorials
make -j4
```
- You will see a new directory containing your new program
