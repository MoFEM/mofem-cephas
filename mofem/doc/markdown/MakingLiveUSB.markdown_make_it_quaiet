## Making Live USB ##

Download image of [Live
USB](http://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/lukasz.kaczmarczyk/custom-backup.iso "Live
USB"). Next prepare USB stick with at least 3GM memory free, however larger
memory sticks are recommend for storing results.

To install ISO image you can use [UNetbootin](https://unetbootin.github.io),
however several other alternatives are available on the internet. Choose option
*Diskimage* and select downloaded ISO file. In addition like to set persistent
space on USB. This is a space on USB needed to store results and to make updates
and changes permanent. It is recommended to set maximal possible size which is
available. If you don't set persistence file, you will be able to make changes
on USB, however after reboot those changes are lost and usb disk back to its
initial state.

Any problems with installation pleas email to
