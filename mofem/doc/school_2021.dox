\subsection school_intro Introduction
 
In this course we will go through the theory of finite elements, approximation methods, and implementation techniques, to solve spectrum of linear/nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). 
The first part of the school contains introduction about MoFEM's code design, overview of heterogeneous and hierarchical basis and explains concept behind pipelines. We show, step by step how by stacking together UDOs starting with simple problems, finite element solver can be extended. We start with a classical Poisson's equation, where basics are introduced. The following linear acoustics example demonstrates solving problems with multiple fields. Subsequently, we explain implementation of vector valued problems on an example of linear elasticity, further extended to a nonlinear case. Finally, a mixed problem is built by composition of simple blocks. Moreover, we exploit the MoFEM's advanced capabilities of using various spaces, heterogeneous and adaptive approximation basis. These examples, demonstrate how each component can be implemented independently, simultaneously (in parallel), by a group of researchers or developers, tested independently, and then composed together into one single pipeline of operators.
