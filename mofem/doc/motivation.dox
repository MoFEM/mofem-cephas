MoFEM (Mesh-oriented Finite Element Method) is a C++ library for managing complexities related to the finite element method (FEM). FEM is a widely used numerical approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in various physical problems. %MoFEM is developed to provide a finite element library incorporating modern approximation approaches and data structures for engineers, students and academics.

%MoFEM belongs to a class of open source finite element libraries, which provide users with generic tools for solving PDEs and developers with frameworks for implementing bespoke finite elements. %MoFEM is specifically designed to solve complex engineering problems, enabling seamless integration of meshes that comprise multiple element types and element shapes, which are typically encountered in industrial applications. The development of %MoFEM has been primarily targeting the problem of crack propagation for structural integrity assessment of safety critical structures like on \ref Figure_1_motivation "Figure 1".

Unique for %MoFEM is that it was created for engineers to solve practical problems, which can not be easily (or not at all) solved by commercial codes. In particular, %MoFEM development was driven by the needs of nuclear engineers in EDF and Jacobs to model crack propagation in nuclear graphite bricks in real core environment. %MoFEM is a research tool, which is design for researchers in computational mechanics which like to make their methods available to engineers.

\subsection mofem_features_ho Higher-order finite element spaces

- %MoFEM supports wide range of spaces, L2, H1, H-div and H-curl

- Numerical trace (interfacial) spaces, on faces and edges

- Integration on skeleton, (enabling easy implementation of Discontinuous Galerkin or Nitsche method)

- Problems with mixed elements shapes (tetrahedrons, prisms, quads, triangles, edges, etc.)

\subsection mofem_features_discretisation Flexible discretization

- Mixed and coupled finite elements

- Interface (e.g. cohesive) elements and shell elements

- Automatic Differentiation by OverLoading in C++ (<a href=https://projects.coin-or.org/ADOL-C>ADOL-C</a>). 
FGetting started
\subsection mofem_features_mesh_types Range of mesh types and topological operations

%MoFEM is implemented with the use of MOAB and deliver the great flexibility of
managing meshes. We can manage range elements types, e.g. prisms, triangles,
quads, bricks and more.

- Unique and extremely flexible \e BitRef Levels (see \ref mix_mesh_refinement)

- Conforming mesh refinement and through MoAB non-conforming mesh refinement.

- Spatial searching and ray tracing (MOAB)

- Distributed meshes (MOAB)

- Arbitrary order definition of mesh geometry

- Readers and writers for many file formats (MOAB)

- Meshing and re-meshing on the flay

- Ability to capture evolving topologies, e.g. implicit crack propagation analysis

- Mesh smoothing and Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian Formulation

\subsection mofem_features_hpc Parallel and scalable

%MoFEM supports MPI-based parallelism throughout the library, and can readily be
used as a scalable unstructured finite element problem generator. Algebra is
building on top of PETSc and geometry description on top of MoAB, both
implementations are tailored for massive parallel calculations.

- %Number of solvers available from PETSc

- Multi-grid solvers

- Efficient tensor library (see \ref ftenso_readme)

- h/p- mesh adaptivity
