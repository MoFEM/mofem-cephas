\section Introduction

MoFEM (Mesh Oriented Finite Element Method) is a new finite element analysis
code tailored for the solution of multi-physics problems with arbitrary levels
of approximation, different levels of mesh refinement and optimised for
high-performance computing. It is design to be able manage complexities related
to heterogenous order of approximations for L2,H1,H-div and H-curl spaces.

MoFEM is the blend of the Boost MultiIndex containers, MOAB (Mesh Oriented
Database) and PETSc (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation).
MoFEM is developed in C++ and it is open-source software under the GNU Lesser
General Public License (see Legal Stuff). The current version of MoFEM has full
support for CUBIT/TRELIS for pre-processing and ParaView for
post-processing. MoFEM will supports other pre-processors, f.e. gMsh and is
currently in the process of full integration with MeshKit.
