In the following document test are based on theoretical developments presented
in paper by Kaczmarczy & Perace \cite kaczmarczyk2014three. In paper \cite
kaczmarczyk2014three a derivation of equations for equilibrium of crack front
from first principles is shown, i.e. the first law of thermodynamics and
principle of maximal dissipation of energy (particular case of second low of
thermodynamics). Crack front is subjected to a constrain emerging form Griffith
fracture criterion.

Independently from theoretical development a method based on face splitting is
proposed to propagate crack. In this test alternative, improved approach is
proposed, leading to implicit, smooth and consistent crack propagation. In
following tests crack is  propagated by directly displacing crack front nodes in
material reference configuration. This ultimately results in mesh distortion, to
resolve that issue a efficient mesh smoothing technique is implemented  \ref
VolumeLengthQuality (see \cite kaczmarczyk2014three and implemented in
constrains \ref SurfaceSlidingConstrains). This result in problem tailored
variant of Total Arbitrary Lagrangian Formulation (T-ALE), in such a way that mesh
smoothing not influencing crack propagation.

Mesh smoothing is not sufficient to fully propagate crack over whole thickness
of the body. A face flipping, node merger and edge splitting algorithm is
further added to algorithm. After each converged load step a mesh topological
changes are introduced to improve mesh quality in neighborhood of crack front.

A finite element in T-ALE setting is implemented in \ref nonlinear_elastic_elem.
Finite element calculate spatial and material forces, which drives body
deformation in physical space and crack front displacements in material space.
Material  forces acting at crack front are equilibrated by Griffith forces
(material resistant forces). Griffith force element is implanted in \ref
GriffithForceElement.
