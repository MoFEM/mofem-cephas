Notes:

Users modules serrated form MoFEM library by independent configuration and
build method. Some functions and classes proven to work will be moved to MoFEM
finite library.

Adding your module:

Pleas add your config files to ModulesList.cmake fiele. 

In each module you can have two type directory data, 
  1) Simple
  2) Extended

1) Simple ditectory structure consist no subdrectories. e.g. elasticity
2) Extended data struture consist subdirectories, e.g. homogenisation

  / <-- programs from which you build executable
  -> /atom_tests
  -> /src <- hpp files
  -> /src/impl <- cpp files form library
  -> /meshes
  -> /data
  
Each module should have README fiele.
