Check before run
================

* Check where is your mesh file
* Check what verion of openmpi (or other MPI library) are you using

Notes
=====

* Exteranl forces and Young modulus are rescaled by factor 1e-8.
* Griffith energy for graphite is 200 * 1e-8 for units consistency.

Example run
===========

1) Calulation stress intensity factor K1

* Calulation of Griffith energy and SIF for mode K1.
* Calulate problem for three approximation orders, i.e. 1 (linear), 2 (quadratic), 3 (qubic).
* Calulate problem for three refinment levels (in proximity of crack front).

* convergence_study.sh NAME_OF_SCRIPT
* -f NAME_OF_FILE 
* -l VALUE_OF_LOAD_FACTOR 
* -g REFERENCE_GRIFFITH_ENERGY 
* -o APPROX_ORDERS_SEPARATED_BY_COMMAS 
* -r REFINMENT_LEVELS_SEPARATED_BY_COMMAS
* -d directory name
* -p number of processors

./convergence_study.sh -f torsion.cub -l 1 -g 8e-5 -o 1 -r 1 -d torsion1 -p 4


2) Calulation of crack propagation

* Crack popagation as an input file uses preoviously obtained soltion from step (1)
* Note that linear elements (1st) order have sheer loking, and usually give overstiff solution

./arc_length.sh -f torsion1/out_spatial_1_1.h5m -a 1 -n 120 -g 8e-6 -d propagation_Order1_Ref1 -p 4

3) Plotting

* check if in your system you have installed awk and grep
* copy and paste to line command
