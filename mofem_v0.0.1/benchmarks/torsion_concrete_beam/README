Check before run
================

* Check where is your mesh file
* Check what version of openmpi (or other MPI library) you are using


Example run
===========

1) Calculation of stress intensity factor K1

* Calculation of Griffith energy and SIF for mode K1.
* Calculate problem for three approximation orders, i.e. 1 (linear), 2 (quadratic), 3 (cubic).
* Calculate problem for three refinement levels (in proximity of crack front).

* convergence_study.sh NAME_OF_SCRIPT
* -f NAME_OF_FILE 
* -l VALUE_OF_LOAD_FACTOR 
* -g REFERENCE_GRIFFITH_ENERGY 
* -o APPROX_ORDERS_SEPARATED_BY_COMMAS 
* -r REFINEMENT_LEVELS_SEPARATED_BY_COMMAS
* -d directory name
* -p number of processors

./convergence_study.sh -f torsion.cub -l 1 -g 8e-5 -o 1,2 -r 1 -d torsion_SIF -p 4


2) Calculation of crack propagation

* Crack propagation as an input file uses previously obtained solution from step (1)
* Note that linear elements (1st order) have sheer locking, and usually give overstiff solution

./arc_length.sh -f torsion_SIF/out_spatial_1_1.h5m -a 1 -n 500 -g 8e-6 -d propagation_Order1_Ref1 -p 4 -t 1e-8 -i 12
./arc_length.sh -f torsion_SIF/out_spatial_2_1.h5m -a 1 -n 500 -g 8e-6 -d propagation_Order2_Ref1 -p 4 -t 1e-8 -i 12


3) Plotting

* check that you have installed awk and grep
* copy and paste to line command

Notes
=====

* arc_length.sh can be run with opetion --snes_linesearch_type=basic,
  then, numer of desicer dumber of iterations should be smaller. With that 
  option, propgram works much fuster, however from time to time it can 
  diverge and need manual restart.
  
  ./arc_length.sh -f torsion_SIF/out_spatial_2_1.h5m -a 1 -n 500 -g 8e-6 -d propagation_Order2_Ref1 -p 4 -t 1e-8 -i 6 --snes_linesearch_type=basic
