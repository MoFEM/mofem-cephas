# Introduction and Motivation

 `MoFEM` (Mesh-oriented Finite Element Method) is a C++ library for managing
 complexities related to the finite element method (FEM). FEM is a widely
 used numerical approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
 arising in various physical problems and engineering applications. `MoFEM`
 is developed to provide free and open source finite element codes,
 incorporating modern approximation approaches and data structures, for
 engineers, students and academics. It was primarily designed to solve crack
 propagation in nuclear graphite bricks (radiated and oxidised) used in
 Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (see Fig. \ref{fig:brick}).

 ![Fracture model of a nuclear graphite brick.\label{fig:brick}](paper_brick.png){width=60%}

 The need for solutions to increasingly complex problems demands control over
 numerical errors; otherwise, we will be unable to distinguish discretisation
 artefacts from the real physical phenomena. A brute force approach based on the
 mesh refinement (so-called *h-adaptivity*) leads to a low polynomial
 convergence rate and, therefore, is severely limited by the current computing
 capabilities. A more elegant approach was paved by Ivo Babuska et al. [@babuska1992version],
 who showed that if one could increase at the same time the mesh density and the
 interpolation order, i.e. employ *hp-adaptivity*, the exponential convergence
 is achievable. This has been seen as the 'Holy Grail' of numerical methods.

 However, raising the order of approximation comes with a cost: the algebraic
 solver time and the matrix assembly time are increased. Unfortunately, there is
 no universal solution to tackle these two difficulties simultaneously. To
 reduce the algebraic solver time, one way is to use multi-grid solvers, which
 can work more efficiently if a hierarchical approximation base is available [@ainsworth2003hierarchic],[@fuentes2015orientation],
 this approach is ideal for elliptic problems such as solid elasticity. However,
 for some problems the efficiency bottleneck could be in the assembly time, e.g.
 for acoustic wave propagation. In that case different approximation bases, such
 as the Bernstein-BÃ©zier base [@ainsworth2011bernstein], allowing for a fast
 numerical integration, could be an optimal solution. Finally, the adaptive
 choice of mesh density and approximation order is driven by the numerical
 errors, which can be effectively estimated if error evaluators are embedded
 into the FE formulation. This leads to a family of mixed or mixed-hybrid finite
 elements that satisfy stability condition if combinations of different
 approximation spaces ($\mathrm{H}^1$, $\mathbf{H}\text{-}\textbf{curl}$,
 $\mathbf{H}\text{-}\textbf{div}$ and $\mathrm{L}^2$) are used.
 
 <!-- Also, `MoFEM` enables users to construct tensorial field on
 tensorial bases, e.g. bubble base of zero normal and divergence free base
 functions, see example of such space in [@gopalakrishnan2012second]. The
 example of five-field mixed formulation (with tensorial bubble base) for large
 strain elasticity is presented in [@kaczmarczyk_lukasz_2019_2640903], and
 results are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:mix}, where `MoFEM` code declaring spaces
 is as follows -->

<!--  ``` c++ 
auto add_hdiv_field = [&](
     const std::string field_name, const int order,
                            const int dim) {
  MoFEMFunctionBegin;
  CHKERR mField.add_field(
    field_name, HDIV, AINSWORTH_LEGENDRE_BASE, dim);
  CHKERR mField.add_ents_to_field_by_type(

  `MoFEM` incorporates all discussed above solutions for *hp-adaptivity*,
  enabling rapid implementation of the finite element method, i.e. relieving the
  user from programming complexities related to bookkeeping of degrees of
  freedom (DOFs), finite elements, matrix assembly, etc. Therefore, `MoFEM`
  provides efficient tools for solving a wide range of complex
  engineering-related problems: multi-dimensional (involving solid, shell and
  beam elements), multi-domain (e.g. interaction between solid and fluid),
  multi-scale (homogenisation with FE$^2$) and multi-physics (e.g.
  thermo-elasticity). Moreover, `MoFEM` supports 'mixed' meshes, consisting of
  different element types, for example, tetrahedra and prisms.

# Design

 ![Basic design of `MoFEM`. Adopted from [@MoFEMWebPage].\label{fig:design}](basic_design.pdf){width=80%}
  
  Modern finite element software is an 'ecosystem' managing various complexities
  related to mesh and topology, sparse algebra and approximation, integration
  and dense tensor algebra at the integration point level. `MoFEM` has not
  developed and will not develop all these capabilities from scratch. Instead,
  `MoFEM` integrates advanced scientific computing tools for sparse algebra from
  [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for
  Scientific Computation) [@petsc-web-page], components for handling mesh and
  topology from [MOAB](https://press3.mcs.anl.gov/sigma/moab-library/)
  (Mesh-Oriented Database) [@tautges_moab:2004] and data structures from [Boost
  libraries](https://www.boost.org) [@boost-web-page]. An illustration of how
  these packages are utilised in `MoFEM` is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:design}.
  Finally, `MoFEM` core library is developed to manage complexities directly
  related to the finite element method. Therefore, each part of this ecosystem
  has its own design objectives and appropriate programming tools from a
  spectrum of solutions can be selected. Resilience of `MoFEM` ecosystem is
  ensured since the underpinning components have sustainable fundings, dynamic
  and established groups of developers and significant user base. Fig.
  \ref{fig:ecosystem} shows different components that are employed in the
  ecosystem including popular pre- and post-processing software.

  <!--  MoFEM makes
  PETSc integral part of code by extending PETSc by DMMOFEM interface (several
  other functions work directly on PETSc objects). MoAB from other hand is
  internal data storage.  -->

  <!--  MoFEM focuses attention on complexities related to finite element
  technology and uses abstractions like field entity, DOF (degree of freedom),
  finite element and problem. -->

  <!-- MoFEM software utilises recent advances
  in the finite element technology and modern data structures, enabling the efficient
  solution of complex, multi-domain, multi-scale and multi-physics problems.  
  -->

  Traditional finite element codes are element-centric, i.e. the type of an
  element defines the approximation space and base. Therefore, they are not able
  to fully exploit the potential of emerging approximation methods. On the
  contrary, the design of data structures for approximation of field variables
  in `MoFEM`  is independent of the specific finite element, e.g. Lagrangian,
  N\tex{\'{e}}d\tex{\'{e}}lec, Raviart-Thomas, since each finite element is constructed by a set of lower
  dimension entities on which the approximation fields are defined.
  Consequently, different approximation spaces ($\mathrm{H}^1$,
  $\mathbf{H}\text{-}\textbf{curl}$, $\mathbf{H}\text{-}\textbf{div}$, $\mathrm{L}^2$)
  can be arbitrarily mixed in a finite element to create new capabilities for
  solving complex problems efficiently. 
  
  <!--   
  It is worth mentioning that the
  approximation space defines the adjacency of DOFs on entities while the number
  of DOFs on entity is independent on approximation base. 
  -->

  
   
  
 <!--  Moreover, the base on entity is a trace of the base on element,
  and opposite relation works, base on entity is extruded into element. -->

  `MoFEM` data structures enable easy enrichment of approximation fields and
  modification of base functions, for example, for resolving singularity at the
  crack front. Applying this technique, it is effortless to construct transition
  elements between domains with different problem formulation and physics, e.g.
  from two-field mixed formulation to a single-field, or elements with an
  anisotropic approximation order, e.g. solid shells with arbitrary high
  approximation order on the surface and arbitrary low order through the thickness
  of the shell. This approach also sets the benchmark in terms of how finite element
  codes are implemented, introducing a concept of user-defined data operators
  acting on fields that are associated with entities (vertices, edges, faces and
  volumes) rather on the finite element directly. Such an approach simplifies
  code writing, testing and validation, making the code more resilient to bugs.

  Furthermore, `MoFEM` core library provides functionality for developing user
  modules where applications for particular problems can be implemented. This
  toolkit-like structure allows for independent development of modules with
  different repositories, owners and licences, being suitable for both
  open-access academic research and private industrial sensitive projects. At
  the same time, `MoFEM` core library is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html),Ã
  it can be deployed and developed using the package manager [Spack](https://spack.io),

  instructions](http://mofem.eng.gla.ac.uk/mofem/html/installation.html) for
  more details.

# Examples and Capabilities

  `MoFEM` was initially created with the financial support of the Royal Academy
  of Engineering and EDF Energy to solve the problem of crack propagation in
  the nuclear graphite [@kaczmarczyk2017energy]. Over
  time, the domain of applications expanded to include computational
  homogenisation (DURACOMP EPSRC Project EP/K026925/1),
  [@ullah2019unified] bone remodelling
  and fracture (Kelvin Smith Scholarship), modelling of the gel rheology [@richardson2018multiphysics] and
  acoustics problems. Moreover, `MoFEM` includes an extensive library of
  example applications such as soap film, solid shell, topology optimisation,
  phase field fracture, Navier-Stokes flow, cell traction microscopy, bone
  remodelling, configurational fracture, plasticity, mortar contact,
  magnetostatics and acoustic wave propagation as shown in Fig.
  \ref{fig:examples}.

  ![Examples of user modules implemented using `MoFEM`.\label{fig:examples}](mofem_modules_examples.png){width=100%}

 `MoFEM` is designed to provide efficient tools for solving a given problem.
 Fig. \ref{fig:shell} shows an example of error-driven *p-adaptivity* on
 hierarchical approximation base with a multi-grid solver applied to the
 Scordelis-Lo perforated roof problem [@kaczmarczyk2016prism]. 
 
  ![Example of *p-adaptivity* for hierarchical and heterogenous approximation with multi-grid solver applied for to Scordelis-Lo perforated roof problem using a solid shell element.\label{fig:shell}](paper_shell.pdf) 
  
  Furthemore, `MoFEM` provides a convenient application programming interface
  allowing a user to freely choose the approximation base (e.g. Legrende or Jacobi
  polynomials) independently from the approximation space, and type and dimension of
  the field. Note that one can approximate scalar and vectorial fields on scalar
  base functions, or vectorial and tensorial fields on vectorial bases.
  Moreover, `MoFEM` permits to construct tensorial fields on tensorial bases,
  e.g. bubble base of zero normal and divergence free base functions, see
  example of such space in [@gopalakrishnan2012second]. A `MoFEM` user can
  freely set approximation order on each entity of an element separately, e.g.
  edge, face, volume, or define a field on the skeleton. In Fig.
  \ref{fig:convergence} we present a convergence study for the mixed formulation of
  a transport/heat conduction problem, and below we outline a snippet for
  defining approximation space, base and order for each field in this example:

  ```c++
  //add fields of fluxes and values to the mesh
  //define approximation space, base and number of coefficients
  CHKERR mField.add_field(fluxes,HDIV,DEMKOWICZ_JACOBI_BASE,1); 
  CHKERR mField.add_field(values,L2,AINSWORTH_LEGENDRE_BASE,1); 
  //get meshset consisting of all entities in mesh
  EntityHandle mesh_set = mField.get_moab().get_root_set();
  //add mesh entities of different type to each field
  //adding tetrahedra implies adding lower dimension entities
  CHKERR mField.add_ents_to_field_by_type(mesh_set,MBTET,fluxes); 
  CHKERR mField.add_ents_to_field_by_type(mesh_set,MBTET,values); 
  //define approximation order for each field 
  //separately for each entity
  CHKERR mField.set_field_order(mesh_set,MBTET,fluxes,order+1); 
  CHKERR mField.set_field_order(mesh_set,MBTRI,fluxes,order+1); 
  CHKERR mField.set_field_order(mesh_set,MBTET,values,order);
  ```

Note that the flux is approximated by the space $\mathbf{H}\text{-}\textbf{div}$, while the field values by the space $\mathrm{L}^2$, see corresponding [MoFEM tutorial page](http://mofem.eng.gla.ac.uk/mofem/html/mix_transport.html) for more details.\label{fig:convergence}](LShape.pdf){ width=80% }
