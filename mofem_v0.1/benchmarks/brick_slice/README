Check before run
================

* Check where is your mesh file
* Check what version of openmpi (or other MPI library) you are using

Note
====

* Pleas note that E,gc and F_external are scaled such that, lambda*F_eternal has unit [ 0.1 kN ] !!!
* Mesh dimensions are in millimetres

Example run
===========

1) Calculation of stress intensity factor K1

* Calculation of Griffith energy and SIF for mode K1.
* Calculate problem for three approximation orders, i.e. 1 (linear), 2 (quadratic), 3 (cubic).
* Calculate problem for three refinement levels (in proximity of crack front).

* convergence_study.sh NAME_OF_SCRIPT
* -f NAME_OF_FILE 
* -l VALUE_OF_LOAD_FACTOR 
* -g REFERENCE_GRIFFITH_ENERGY 
* -o APPROX_ORDERS_SEPARATED_BY_COMMAS 
* -r REFINEMENT_LEVELS_SEPARATED_BY_COMMAS
* -d directory name
* -p number of processors

./convergence_study.sh -f brick_slice.cub -l -1e-5 -o 1 -r 1 -d TEST_SIF -p 4 

2) Calculation of crack propagation

* Crack propagation as an input file uses previously obtained solution from step (1)
* Note that linear elements (1st order) have sheer locking, and usually give overstiff solution

Uasge: 
./face_split_arc_length.sh -h
run this for more information about options.

gc = 230 J/m^2 

da = 1 mm^2 (this control arc-length, if too beek can generate
oscillations at crack front at beginning of symmylation)

./face_split_arc_length.sh -f TEST_SIF/out_spatial_1_1.h5m -a 1 -n 100 -g 2.3e-8 -d TEST_ARC_O1_R1 -t 1e-8 -p 4

Making plots
============

echo '0 0 0 0' | tee gp && grep load_path: test_prop/log | awk '{print $4,-$6,$8,-2*$8/$6 }' | tee -a gp
