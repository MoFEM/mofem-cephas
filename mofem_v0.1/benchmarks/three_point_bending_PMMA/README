Check before run
================

* Check where is your mesh file
* Check what version of openmpi (or other MPI library) you are using

Note
====

* Please note that E,gc and F_external are scaled such that, E has unit [ 1 N/mm2 ]
* Mesh dimensions are in millimetres

Example run
===========

1) Calculation of stress intensity factor K1

* Calculation of Griffith energy and SIF for mode K1.
* Calculate problem for four approximation orders, i.e. 1 (linear), 2 (quadratic), 3 (cubic), 4 (quartic).
* Calculate problem for one refinement level (in proximity of crack front).

* convergence_study.sh NAME_OF_SCRIPT
* -f NAME_OF_FILE 
* -l VALUE_OF_LOAD_FACTOR 
* -g REFERENCE_GRIFFITH_ENERGY 
* -o APPROX_ORDERS_SEPARATED_BY_COMMAS 
* -r REFINEMENT_LEVELS_SEPARATED_BY_COMMAS
* -d directory name
* -p number of processors

./convergence_study.sh -f PMMA_45degrees.cub -l -1 -g 2.75e-4 -o 1,2,3 -r 1,2 -p $NPROC

2) Calculation of crack propagation

* Crack propagation as an input file uses previously obtained solution from step (1)
* Note that linear elements (1st order) have sheer locking, and usually give overstiff solution

./face_split_arc_length.sh -f $DIRNAME/out_spatial_2_1.h5m -a 1 -n 100 -g 2.75e-4 -p $NPROC


Making plots
============

* plot_graphs.sh NAME_OF_SCRIPT 
* -o APPROX_ORDERS_SEPARATED_BY_COMMAS 
* -r REFINEMENT_LEVELS_SEPARATED_BY_COMMAS
* -a DESIRED ANGLE OF INCLINATION OF CRACK FRONT

./plot_graphs_PMMA.sh -o 1,2,3 -r 1,2,3,4 -a 45
