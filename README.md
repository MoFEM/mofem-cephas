# **MoFEM (JosePH)** #

**MoFEM (Mesh Oriented Finite Element Method)** is a new finite element analysis code tailored for the solution of multi-physics problems with arbitrary levels of approximation, different levels of mesh refinement and optimised for high-performance computing. MoFEM is the blend of the **[Boost](http://www.boost.org) MultiIndex** containers, **[MOAB](https://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/ITAPS/wiki/MOAB)** (Mesh Oriented Database) and **[PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/)** (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation). MoFEM is developed in C++ and it is open-source software under the [GNU](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/) Lesser General Public License. The current version of MoFEM has full support for **[CUBIT](https://cubit.sandia.gov/)**/**[TRELIS](http://csimsoft.com/)** v13 for pre-processing and **[ParaView](http://www.paraview.org/)** v4.1 for post-processing.
